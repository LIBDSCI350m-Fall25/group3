# Data Management Plan and Documentation:  


## The Bicycle Revolution - Fashions and Freedoms

Our team utilized Google Sheets to develop and organize our metadata, GitHub to host and manage the final website, and CollectionBuilder to structure and present our thematic digital project. Together, these tools supported a collaborative and adaptable workflow from start to finish.
Our project focuses on the personal freedoms people discovered during the Bicycle Revolution of the 20th century. By combining visual materials with structured metadata, we created a collection that allows scholars to explore questions about everyday fashion, bicycle customization, and diverse modes of transportation. This approach reveals how individuals used personal style and mobility to express independence.
Through CollectionBuilder and GitHub, we developed an accessible and visually engaging website that invites all audiences to discover how people used bicycles as a form of identity, self-expression, and participation in a changing cultural landscape.


## Technical Team and Expertise: 

- **Andre** - *Repository Manager*: The repository manager is responsible to make sure the collection follows the MAP and file format requirements for storing so it can be uploaded to CollectionBuilder, adding the collection description, data management plan (DMP), and data documentation to the GitHub repository. The team also validates and troubleshoots any issues that come up during the upload process. In addition, I assist the project manager with finalizing the DMP and data documentation, take notes during group meetings, and manage the final setup of the GitHub repository and CollectionBuilder implementation, also leading the technical troubleshooting and handling any platform related problems.

- **Billy** - *Object Preservation Manager*: The preservation manager is responsible for how different objects are added into the project's storage space and also works together with the development manager to finalize and choose what is the best file format for the project.  I also must keep the standard of file naming and preservation formats. Most importantly, the object preservation must ensure backup copies of all project materials.

- **Britta** - *Collection Development Manager*: The Collection Development Manager is responsible for deciding which materials should be included in the collection and works with the Object Preservation Manager to choose the best file formats for the project. They make sure that all copyright and licensing information is properly recorded and organized, and they write descriptions that explain what the collection contains. The manager also helps decide on research topics and defines the overall scope of the collection to ensure it stays meaningful and useful for the collection.

- **Ceilidh** - *Project Manager*: Coordinated communication with instructor and team, and ensured infrastructure setup for the team’s internal virtual database. Prepared and coordinated the team for the Progress Report, Data Management Plan, documentation, and Final Project. The project manager also ensured all meeting notes are recorded and stored properly in the Google Drive; also managed by them. Additionally, the project manager was responsible for submitting all of the team’s final work to the instructor. To support the rest of the team, Ceilidh also helped refine and clean up all group work before submission.

- **Hailey** - *Metadata Manager*: The metadata manager ensures that all objects follow the project’s metadata application profile. Essentially, they make sure that all objects are organized, correct, and done in the same format each time. The metadata manager standardizes all data entry based on the requirements described by CollectionBuilder. Additionally, it is the metadata manager’s job to create a master spreadsheet where all of the information is stored and maintained. There are also official standards that the metadata manager needs to follow such as Dublin Core and CollectionBuilder that help make the collection easy to search, read, and understand.


## Anticipated Data: 

For our data, we standardized all image files to be under JPEG format, the configuration for the site is done on yml files, built on html, item information were parsed into csv’s, with finally markdown files for the repository structure and organization. The license used on the repository was MIT formatted, about half of our items fell into the no rights category, while the rest had a copyright statement declaration that unless expressly stated otherwise, the organization that has made each Item available made no warranties about the Item and cannot guarantee the accuracy of this Rights Statement, mostly followed from no creator items. Additionally 4 items had a creative commons rights license with a display of no rights reserved. Total data volume including repo and items comes to about 6.3 after compression. 

- JPEG images (.jpg): ~16 MB
*(Standardized image files created from downloading archive items)*
- Metadata (.csv): <2 MB
*(Metadata spreadsheet exported from Google Sheets)*
- YAML configuration (.yml): <1 MB
*(Site configuration files for CollectionBuilder)*
- Markdown documentation (.md): <1 MB
*(MAP documentation, project notes, DMP, and supporting documentation)*
- HTML/CSS/JS (website): ~3–5 MB
*(Static site output produced automatically by CollectionBuilder)*


## Data Sourcing: 

Object files were sourced from the following GLAMS:

- Library of congress prints and photographs division
- New York Public Libraries, Digital Collections
- Oregon Digital Unique Cultural Heritage Collection
- Los Angeles Public Library, Photo Collection
- Oregon Historical Society. Library. (Digital Collections)
- University of Minnesota Libraries, University Archives
- Denver Public Library, (Digital Collections)
- National Museum of American History
- Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum Collection Drawings, Prints, and - Graphic Design Department Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC, Gift of Joseph H. Hirshhorn, 1966
-- National Postal Museum
- Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC, Gift of Joseph H. Hirshhorn, 1966

## Storage and Backup: 

- **Google Drive:** We used a shared Google Drive as our daily main workspace. It acted as a central hub where all 5 members of our team could collaborate. In the Drive, There are certain folders that holds the original, raw images we downloaded from the archives, our planning documents, and the master spreadsheet where we write out metadata.  This Google Drive allows everyone to work on files at the same time and ensures we don’t lose anything while we are gathering research. 

- **GitHub:** GitHub is where the finished project is held. It acts as our final storage and publishes our website. GitHub held the final objects, MAP, and metadata CSV file. GitHub is especially useful because it keeps a history of the changes we make. It can also protect our data from accidental deletion.

- **Personal computers:** The Object Preservation Manager downloaded raw files from the drive to their computer to rename and reformat them. The computer acted as a third backup. While they processed the files, copies exist on my hard drive, keeping them safe while moving them from Google Drive to GitHub.

## File Naming Convention:  

**Example:** <ins>acc_nypldc_1939-1940_photo_womanridingbicycle</ins>

Group 3 File Naming Standard PDF can be found in group repository under "[objects/file_naming_standard.pdf](https://github.com/LIBDSCI350m-Fall25/group3/blob/main/objects/file_naming_standard.pdf)"

File naming standard includes
- **Cataloger Initials**
- **Repository Acronym**
- **Date**
- **Format Type**
- **Object Name**

*Please review documentation for further details on individual naming standard segments.*


## Licensing & Copyright

All of our objects are at minimum available for non-commercial use; including No Copyright, Copyright Undetermined, Copyright Not Evaluated, CC0 usage, and an In Copyright item that allows public use. Our purposes for these objects are entirely educational, non-commercial, and are to the benefit of open-access sources and information. For the Licensing and Ethical standpoint, our group understands our project to fall under “CC0”; or “No Rights Reserved” as we do not have the final say in the publicality of these objects. Any further reference or use of these objects requires further research and communication with the original repository’s Licensing and Copyright agreements. 


## Data Preservation/Retention 

### Period of Data Retention: 

The Project Manager has agreed to do monthly checkups on the object files and metadata to ensure consistency and no changes have been made from the source until the end of the current school year, ending in **June of 2026**.
